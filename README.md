# plx-gc-categories

Plug-in written for Pluxml >5.8.5 + , running php 7.2.19 (8 should be fine)

The idea is to set categories as main categories(mother) and relate others(daughterOf) to a mother categorie.
When going throught the website, sidebar should only show sisters of that mother catégorie as for last articles and related tags links.

A link to the mother categorie can be inserted within the breadcrumbs. 

Links to the mother categorie(s) can also be added to the nav menu.

Archives and tags page do not filter the catégorie.

But, What is PluXML ?
It is an easy and light CMS using XML file to store datas.
Official Website : https://pluxml.org/ 

Here is an example of the plugin in action, <br>

sorting in four groups the twelve books of the 240 " Fables de la Fontaine" . 

Have fun, take care.
