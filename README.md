# plx-gc-categories

Plug-in written for Pluxml 5.6 and above running php 7.2.19 (8 should be fine)

The idea is to set categories as main categories(mother) and relate others(daughterOf) to a mother categorie.
When going throught the website, sidebar should only show sisters of that mother catégorie. 

?? Let's say your PluXml blogs about movies,so you  set a few categories like sci-fi, animation, action, ... 
then you can set daughter categories to those categories. while browsing subcategories, the sidebar will only show sister catégories instead showing all categories avalaible on the website.

What is PluXML ?
It is an easy and light CMS using XML file to store datas.

Have fun, take care.
