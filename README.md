# plx-gc-categories

Plug-in written for Pluxml 5.x running php 7.2.19

The idea is to set categories as main categories(mother) and relate others(daughterOf) to a main categorie.
When going throught the website, sidebar should only show linksof  categories related to the main cat√©gorie. 
Let's say your PluXml blogs about movies, you can set a few categories like sci-fi, animation, action, ... 
then relate to each any subcategories. while browsing subcategories, the sidebar will only show subcategories 
related to the main categorie(mother) which is also shown.
